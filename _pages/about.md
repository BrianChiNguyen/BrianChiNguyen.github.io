<strong style="color: orange;">About Me</strong>
<div class="excerpt-content">
  <p>
Hi there, I'm Chi Cong Nguyen - <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q0oMHaYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"><strong>Brian Nguyen</strong></a>, a Ph.D. Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of New South Wales - <a href="http://medicalrobotics-lab.weebly.com/people.html" target="_blank"><strong>UNSW</strong></a>, Sydney, Australia. My research focuses on extending the reach of teleoperated flexible surgical robotic systems for cardiac and gastrointestinal disorders, exploring areas such as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adsr.202200036" target="_blank"><strong>Soft Robotics, Surgical Robots, and Haptics</strong></a>. In 2019, I was a Valedictorian earning an excellent Degree of Engineer in Mechatronics from Hanoi University of Science and Technology - HUST. Following that, I worked as a Mechanical Designer in 5G project at Viettel High Technology Industries Corporation (VHT) in Vietnam for two years. In 2021, I received a full scholarship from <a href="https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/cohort-2021/" target="_blank"><strong>Vingroup Scholarship Program, Vietnam</strong></a> and commenced my Ph.D. Currently in my third year (2024), I am actively engaged in two projects utilizing a developed Soft Syringe Architecture (SSA) to simplify and reduce costs and complexity in soft robotics, particularly in surgical robots and haptic devices. <br>
<strong style="color: orange;">My Technical Skills:</strong> Mechanical Design (Solidworks), Protyping (Hands-on), Mathematical Modeling (MATLAB/Wolfram-Mathematica), Embedded Programming (Arduino/Raspberry Pi/C++/Python), Image Processing (MATLAB/Python), Computer Vision (Anything Segmentation), Simulating (ANSYS/COMSOL-Multiphisics).

**10000 Subscribers to my Youtube Channel - [Brian's School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2kmxhjbbunoNEPyG-ENfoA)**

<div class="excerpt-content">
  <p>
I lauched my Youtube channel - Brian's School about one year ago. I don't often post videos due to my hectic schedule, so far, I  have only 22 videos. These videos are mainly about my study techniques and tips that I want to share with high school and university students to motivate and assist them in their learning endeavors. I didn't anticipate garnering much attention from viewers, but I'm deeply grateful to all of my dedicated fans for their unwavering support. Your encouragement means the world to me.
